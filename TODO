Go forward in the box layout (positioning) code. (hard, very hard).
This is gonna take me a coupe of months I think.
 cr-lay-eng.c:adjust_edges_on_inner_edge() code the TODO of this
 method. this is the must have before coding the draw_box() function.
 I wonder when the draw_box will enable me to see something on the
 screen.
 that day would then be a great day.
