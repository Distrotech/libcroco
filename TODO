Well, in the cr_statement_xxx_parse_functions, memleaks 
occur (the parsing result set in the sac callback is not freed)
when a parsing fails. This is because I haven't implemented
the "error" SAC callbacks yet. I must do it !!!

More debug of the test case for cr_statement_parse_from_buf ().

Provide support for font selection. (hard, started, is well underway.)
 First make sure to be able to gather all the font related property
  values.
 Then, figure out how to implement a font selector that uses pango.

Go forward in the cascading implementation in cr-sel-eng.c
     test/debug it.
     write test cases to test/debug/validate this kind of stylesheets:
       P {border: thick}
       P {display: block}
       /*
        *stylesheets where the same selector is used several times
        *to define different declarations.
        */
     write test cases to test/debug/validate the multi stylesheet support.


*Doc:)

Write examples of how to use the SAC api of libcroco and how to
walk the css stylesheet tree.

Finish the design of the instruction set of the selection engine.
	The draft design is in the file 
	docs/designs/docs/design/sel-instr.txt.

Write a litte doc about how to use the parser as it is today.
