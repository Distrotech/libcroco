	* Makefile.am:
	Change _DATA to _HEADERS for header
	
	* src/Makefile.am:
	Only use filename for _HEADERS.
	remove libcroco-config.h from _HEADERS

2003-04-12  dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* src/* made a big change of the source tree.
	Now, the whole thing is divided in 3 parts:
	the paser, the selection engine and the layout engine.
	The parser source files produce a libcroco.so shared lib.
	The selection engine source files produce a libcrseleng.so shared
	library.
	The layout engine source fils produce a libcrlayeng.so shared
	library.
	The same configure options as before apply.

2003-04-05  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* src/cr-token.h (struct _CRToken): 
	applied a patch from Greg Lee <greg@ling.lll.hawaii.edu>,
	which solves a compilation error under gcc 2.95.3. Basically,
	it transforms an implicitly defined  union into an explicitly
	defined one. Modified all the files impacted.
	
2003-04-03  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* tests/testctl: can now run one single test. This can also
	run all the tests a run a simple report that summarizes the
	results of the tests.

	* configure.in: make sure this generates the libcroco.spec file.
	make sure to test the presence of glib2 during configure.

	* libcroco.spec.in: added autoconf magic in this.
	Can now generate an rpm by typing make rpm. Before that,
	the user that types make rpm must have write acess to
	/usr/src .

2003-04-02  Gaël Chamoulaud (strider) <strider@freespiders.org>
	
	* croco-config.1: updated the man page
	* csslint/csslint.1: updated the man page

2003-04-01  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* tests/testctl: started to code the libcroco test launcher script.
	it is not useable yet, but work is in progress.

2003-03-31  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>
	* src/cr-lay-eng.c: started to code the tree annotation process.
	I seriously need to debug this.
	
	* configure.in: put in there the list of tests to be compile
	and the conditions cause AM_CONDITIONAL() is buggy and does
	not seem to fit my needs. Also modified tests/Makefile.am
	to take this in account.
	
	* tests/test7-main.c: added this file to debug the layout engine
	related stuffs.

	* croco-config.1: some minor fixes in the man page.
	
2003-03-30 Christian Schaller <uraeus@gnome.org>
	* Fixed disting by adding manpages to EXTRA_DIST
	* Added spec.in file, this need to be added to build 
	  system to generate .spec file.
	* Remove Makefile.in from CVS, this is a generated file
	
2003-03-30  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>
	* autogen.sh: 
	Made sure that in dev mode, the configure scripts
	gets called with --enable-tests=yes --enable-seleng=yes
	--enable-layeng=yes. This options being set to 'no' by default.

	* src/cr-lay-eng.c: 
	Started to code a layout engine. This is more a design
	sketch than real usefull code so far.

        * src/cr-cascade.c:
	Started to code a #CRCascade class to abstract a css2 cascade.	
	This is more a placeholder (or a design sketch) than real
	usefull code today.
	
	* tests/Makefile.am: improved the conditional compilation
	of the tests; e.g if the selection engine feature is disabled
	the selection engine tests won't be compiled.	
	* configure.in: added --enable-layeng to contionaly compile
	the layout engine files. Also improved the handling of
	of the enable-xxx arguments => 'yes' forces the feature to
	be enabled (the coder knows what he is doing); 'auto' checks
	if the features xxx depends on are available and then
	switches xxx on.

2003-03-24  dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>
	* src/cr-style.c (cr_style_set_style_from_decl): 
	Have a first hot (and bugged) implem of this function.	
	I can now, go and get worried about building the annotated
	xml tree.

2003-03-20  Gaël Chamoulaud  <strider@freespiders.org>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added man page for croco-config

2003-03-20  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

2003-03-20  Gaël Chamoulaud  <strider@freespiders.org>

	* configure.in: added conditional compilation of the unit tests
	in tests/ subdir 

	* tests/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): conditional compilation of the unit tests
	in tests/ subdir 

2003-03-19  Gaël Chamoulaud  <strider@freespiders.org>

	* Relicense from GPL -> LGPL

2003-03-18  Gaël Chamoulaud  <strider@freespiders.org>

	* configure.in: fixed a configure bug. Make sure to properly
	check the libxml2 versions.

2003-03-18  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

	* autogen.sh: Use gnome-autogen (cvs co gnome-common). Creates libtool
	and other things properly

	* configure.in: better check for LIBXML2, conditional compilation of
	the SELENG module

	* tests/Makefile.am: disable test5 until I can think of a better 
	work-around

	system

	* tests/README-description.txt: 
	added this test description file in the project.
	
	* src/cr-sel-eng.c (cr_sel_eng_get_matched_rulesets_real):

	this new one. Modified it memory management model so that 
	1/ it does not allocate it output array
	2/ caller can use it in a incremental way and get the rulesets
	chunck by chunk.
	(cr_sel_eng_sel_get_matched_rulesets): 
	added this public interface based on the private interface
	cr_sel_eng_get_matched_rulesets_real().
	

2003-03-02  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* src/cr-sel-eng.c (cr_sel_eng_get_rulesets_real):
