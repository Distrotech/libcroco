2003-05-05  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* tests/test7-main.c: small update for debug purposes.

	* src/layeng/cr-style.h: cleanup.

	* src/layeng/cr-lay-eng.c: put in here what is needed to support
	border-x and border-style-x properties.

	* src/layeng/cr-box.[ch]: make CRBoxModel inherits CRBox.

	* src/layeng/cr-box-view.c: start to support the border-style-x and
	border-x property. I must test this.

	* configure.in: defined a personal environment where I can set
	the CFLAGS I want.

2003-05-04  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* src/parser/cr-tknzr.c:
	(cr_tknzr_get_next_token ()) fixed a small bug in here.
	
	* src/layeng/cr-style.[ch]: 
	Deeply Modified the layout of the CRStyle structure for 
	1/group all numerical properties together in a table.
	2/group all color (rgb) properties together in another table.
	3/group all border style properties together in another table.
	That way, accessing those properties is more efficient.
	4/make sure that each properties can have 3 values:
	specified, computed and actual value as specified by the css2 spec. 
	(I doubt actuall value is usefull
	here though).
	Modified the file to make this be coherent again.

	* src/layeng/cr-lay-eng.c :
	Made this coherent after the change of the CRStyle structure.
	
	(normalize_num ()):created this function to
	normalize numerical properties.
	(style_specified_2_computed_values ): 
	new function to computed css2 "computed values" from specified values.
	This is required by the css2 spec in chap 6.1.
	(create_box_tree_real): updated this to make it call 
	style_specified_2_computed_values () before actually building the box.

2003-05-01  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* configure.in, csslint/Makefile.am, src/parser/Makefile.am, src/seleng/Makefile.am, src/layeng/Makefile.am: 
	fixed #111895

2003-04-28  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* tests/test7-main.c: woohoo, this now shows some text. 
	Okay, it is a crappy design sketch, but this is a milestone.

	* src/layeng/cr-lay-eng.c: store the created label widget in the cache.
	box content cache.
	* src/layeng/cr-box.h:created a box content cache to store the label 
	widget used to calculate text box size.
	
	* src/layeng/cr-box-view.[hc]: made this simpler and manage to
	make it show someting on the screen. Now the box view
	is just the view port. To render the box model, we just walk thru it
	and draw each box in the box view.
	

2003-04-26  dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>
	
	* configure.in: made sure to include the libgnomeui clflags and
	 libsflags to croco libs and croco cflags when the layeng is turned
	 on.
	* csslint/Makefile.am: made sure to use the CROCO_LIBS and CROCO_CLFAGS
	 variables.
	* src/libcroco.h: added the cr-box-view.h include file
	* src/layeng/cr-box-view.c: started to write a draw_box() function that
	 will draw the box tree on the screen.
	* src/layeng/cr-lay-eng.c: removed the adjust_edges_on_inner_edge () function.
	* tests/Makefile.am: made sure to include libgnomeui clfags and libs
	 when layeng is turned on.
	* tests/test7-main.c: made started to include a cr-box-view.c test.

2003-04-20  dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* tests/test7-main.c: updated the test7 code to see the layout in
	action.

	* src/layeng/cr-style.[ch]: just modified some rule 
	names for convenience.

	* src/layeng/cr-lay-eng.[ch]:
	when forward in normal flow layout code. Have now very basic layout code.
	Still have to write a canvas code to render the layed out box.

        * src/layeng/cr-lay-eng.c (compute_text_box_inner_edge_size): started to work on the
	the inner edge size computation based on pango.

	* src/layeng/Makefile.am: updated to compile/link against libgnomeui.
	* configure.in: updated it to test the presence
	of libgnomeui if and only if the layout engine is enabled.

2003-04-15  Alexander Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	Change _DATA to _HEADERS for header
	
	* src/Makefile.am:
	Only use filename for _HEADERS.
	remove libcroco-config.h from _HEADERS

2003-04-12  dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* src/* made a big change of the source tree.
	Now, the whole thing is divided in 3 parts:
	the paser, the selection engine and the layout engine.
	The parser source files produce a libcroco.so shared lib.
	The selection engine source files produce a libcrseleng.so shared
	library.
	The layout engine source fils produce a libcrlayeng.so shared
	library.
	The same configure options as before apply.

2003-04-05  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* src/cr-token.h (struct _CRToken): 
	applied a patch from Greg Lee <greg@ling.lll.hawaii.edu>,
	which solves a compilation error under gcc 2.95.3. Basically,
	it transforms an implicitly defined  union into an explicitly
	defined one. Modified all the files impacted.
	
2003-04-03  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* tests/testctl: can now run one single test. This can also
	run all the tests a run a simple report that summarizes the
	results of the tests.

	* configure.in: make sure this generates the libcroco.spec file.
	make sure to test the presence of glib2 during configure.

	* libcroco.spec.in: added autoconf magic in this.
	Can now generate an rpm by typing make rpm. Before that,
	the user that types make rpm must have write acess to
	/usr/src .

2003-04-02  Gaël Chamoulaud (strider) <strider@freespiders.org>
	
	* croco-config.1: updated the man page
	* csslint/csslint.1: updated the man page

2003-04-01  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* tests/testctl: started to code the libcroco test launcher script.
	it is not useable yet, but work is in progress.

2003-03-31  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>
	* src/cr-lay-eng.c: started to code the tree annotation process.
	I seriously need to debug this.
	
	* configure.in: put in there the list of tests to be compile
	and the conditions cause AM_CONDITIONAL() is buggy and does
	not seem to fit my needs. Also modified tests/Makefile.am
	to take this in account.
	
	* tests/test7-main.c: added this file to debug the layout engine
	related stuffs.

	* croco-config.1: some minor fixes in the man page.
	
2003-03-30 Christian Schaller <uraeus@gnome.org>
	* Fixed disting by adding manpages to EXTRA_DIST
	* Added spec.in file, this need to be added to build 
	  system to generate .spec file.
	* Remove Makefile.in from CVS, this is a generated file
	
2003-03-30  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>
	* autogen.sh: 
	Made sure that in dev mode, the configure scripts
	gets called with --enable-tests=yes --enable-seleng=yes
	--enable-layeng=yes. This options being set to 'no' by default.

	* src/cr-lay-eng.c: 
	Started to code a layout engine. This is more a design
	sketch than real usefull code so far.

        * src/cr-cascade.c:
	Started to code a #CRCascade class to abstract a css2 cascade.	
	This is more a placeholder (or a design sketch) than real
	usefull code today.
	
	* tests/Makefile.am: improved the conditional compilation
	of the tests; e.g if the selection engine feature is disabled
	the selection engine tests won't be compiled.	
	* configure.in: added --enable-layeng to contionaly compile
	the layout engine files. Also improved the handling of
	of the enable-xxx arguments => 'yes' forces the feature to
	be enabled (the coder knows what he is doing); 'auto' checks
	if the features xxx depends on are available and then
	switches xxx on.

2003-03-24  dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>
	* src/cr-style.c (cr_style_set_style_from_decl): 
	Have a first hot (and bugged) implem of this function.	
	I can now, go and get worried about building the annotated
	xml tree.

2003-03-20  Gaël Chamoulaud  <strider@freespiders.org>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added man page for croco-config

	* Relicense from GPL -> LGPL

2003-03-18  Gaël Chamoulaud  <strider@freespiders.org>

	* configure.in: fixed a configure bug. Make sure to properly
	check the libxml2 versions.

2003-03-18  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

	and other things properly

	* configure.in: better check for LIBXML2, conditional compilation of
	the SELENG module

	chunck by chunk.
	(cr_sel_eng_sel_get_matched_rulesets): 
	added this public interface based on the private interface
	cr_sel_eng_get_matched_rulesets_real().
	

2003-03-02  Dodji  <dodji@seketeli.org>

	* src/cr-sel-eng.c (cr_sel_eng_get_rulesets_real): 
	started to code an implementation of a ruleset "requester".
